AutoCoder is a GitHub Actions project that explores the intersection of AI and DevOps automation. This tool uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT to generate code based on the content of GitHub issues, transforming plain English descriptions into functioning source code. Once the code is generated, the action automatically creates a new branch, commits the changes, and opens a pull request—ready for review and integration. The goal is to reduce manual effort, improve developer productivity, and create a faster feedback loop between ideation and implementation. AutoCoder supports custom prompts, issue templates, branch naming schemes, and can be configured to trigger from labels, comments, or issue creation. It’s ideal for rapid prototyping, writing tests, scaffolding boilerplate, or exploring AI-assisted development workflows. By bridging natural language and source code, AutoCoder brings AI directly into the software development lifecycle. This project is a solo effort and a hands-on experiment in building intelligent automation inside GitHub repositories using open tools.
